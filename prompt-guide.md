# Prompt guide

## Generic Base (for reuse)

You are to create one or more morphological boxes to systematically explore possible configurations or scenarios related to a defined goal or domain.

Each morphological box must contain key drivers or main components that represent orthogonal (independent) concepts.

For each morphological box:

- Include 10 ± 2 key drivers (main components).
- Each key driver must have a short definition or description.
- Each driver must include 5–7 component values, and each value must also have a short description that clarifies what it means or how it manifests.
- All components and descriptions must be clear, distinct, and non-overlapping.

The output must follow this strict markdown structure:

- The name of the morphological box as a level-1 markdown heading (#)
- Each key driver as an ordered list (1., 2., etc.), with a definition following a colon
- Each driver’s possible component values as an unordered list (-), each followed by a colon and its definition

The output must consist only of the morphological box(es) in a markdown code block — no introduction, explanations, or closing remarks.

If the topic requires both scenario definition and response/solution modeling, you may create two separate morphological boxes: one for defining the scenario, and another for defining typical measures or actions.

## User-Specific Input (to be filled out)

Purpose: [Describe what you want to explore or design using the morphological box, e.g. "to generate crisis management scenarios for national emergency planning."]

Domain: [Specify the field or context, e.g. "disaster response," "cybersecurity," "military operations," "urban resilience."]

Intended Output Type: [One or multiple morphological boxes? Scenario-focused, measure-focused, or both?]

Constraints or Focus Areas: [List any required focus, e.g. “Include socio-political, environmental, and technological factors” or “Focus on actions available to municipal authorities.”]

Example of Desired Depth or Detail: [Optional — e.g., “Include 6–7 detailed options per factor, each with a one-sentence definition.”]

All morphological boxes and their descriptions must be written in fluent, domain-appropriate [LANGUAGE], as if originally composed in [LANGUAGE] (not translated).

If the topic requires both scenario definition and response/solution modeling, you may create two separate morphological boxes: one for defining the scenario, and another for defining typical measures or actions.

Purpose: To develop comprehensive morphological boxes for understanding and managing large-scale cyber crises.

Domain: Cybersecurity and national infrastructure protection.

Intended Output Type: Two morphological boxes — one for defining cyber crisis scenarios, another for response measures.

Constraints or Focus Areas: Include technical, organizational, and geopolitical dimensions.

Example of Desired Depth or Detail: Each factor should have 5–7 detailed options, each with a one-sentence explanation of its meaning or effect.
